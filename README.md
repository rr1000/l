# Hello Lucy

## The Problem
Pets are just as unique as their human counterparts. Understanding who you are and how your body works is vitally important to improving your lifestyle, decreasing your chances of illness, and thriving throughout adulthood.

This is also true of pets. Getting to know your pet, their likes and dislikes takes a lot of work. Often times we rely on veterinary professionals to give us the guidance that we need. However they can’t always be there every step of the way.  At some level we need to have a better understanding of our pets so we can be the best caretakers possible. We want to give our animals a happy and healthy lifestyle.

Currently we use a variety of disjointed tools to get this high level view our of pets health; DNA tests are common among veterinary clinics and take home kits that you can order online. This gives a brief glimpse into the makeup of our pets’ DNA data, but this data isn’t actionable. Outside of administering these tests we might use an IoT feeder, wearables, and a lot of manual cataloging to understand our pets. However this is annoying, messy, and most importantly unhelpful.

## Enter Lucy
